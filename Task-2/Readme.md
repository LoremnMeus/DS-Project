Models about task-2 are all packed in file Project.ipynb. 
To test MLP progress, run the code block in order of 1,2,3,(7 for PCA),8,9,13,14.
To test CNN progress, run the code block in order of 1,2,3,7,8,16,17,18.
To test Integrative MLP progress, run the code block in order of 1,2,3,6,10,13,14.
To test GCN progress, run the code block in order of 1,2,3,5,11,19,20,21,22,23.
Best result of CNN model and GCN model are also packed together. They are cnn.pkl and gcn.pkl.
